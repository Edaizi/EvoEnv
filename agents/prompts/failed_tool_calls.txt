When a tool's usage doesn't produce the results you expect, you **must** log it using the `<failed_tool_calls></failed_tool_calls>` tag **immediately**.

For every failed tool call, include:
- tool_name:
- parameters/inputs:
- error_messages:
- solution: (optional)

Multiple incorrect calls are separated by newlines.

Output format example:

<failed_tool_calls>
- tool_name:
- parameters/inputs:
- error_messages:
- solution:

- tool_name:
- parameters/inputs:
- error_messages:
</failed_tool_calls>
