# Welcome to KnowledgeX! Intern Handbook

Hello,

A very warm welcome to the team at KnowledgeX! We are thrilled to have you with us.

Starting a new role can bring up a lot of questions about how things work, who's who, and where to go for help. This handbook is designed to be your guide. It will help you identify the right person to contact when you need assistance.

Remember, ASKING QUESTIONS to the right people is a key part of learning and growing here. Let's get started!

## Intern Tips: Who to Ask for Help?

Navigating a new company can be tricky. Here’s a quick guide to help you find the right person for your questions.

#### **1. When you have questions about your specific tasks or projects...**
*   *e.g., "What is the goal of this task?", "How should I get started on this code?", "Is this the top priority?"*
*   **➡️ Who to ask:** Your direct **Manager** (e.g., Engineering Manager, Marketing Manager). You can also ask a **Senior team member** in your department (like a Senior Software Engineer).
*   **Why:** Your Manager is responsible for your work and growth. Senior colleagues have deep project knowledge and are a great resource for technical or domain-specific questions.

#### **2. When you have questions about your contract, payroll, leave policy, or other HR-related topics...**
*   *e.g., "When is payday?", "How do I request a day off?", "I have a question about my internship agreement.", "Who is in charge of IT service?"*
*   **➡️ Who to ask:** The **HR Generalist** or the **HR Manager**.
*   **Why:** The Human Resources department is the official source for all administrative and employment-related policies.

#### **3. When you need help with company finances, like completing a data review task...**
*   *e.g., "How do I get reimbursed for a company-approved purchase?", "How do I complete a data review task?"*
*   **➡️ Who to ask:** An **Accountant** in the Finance department, or your **Finance Manager**.
*   **Why:** They manage all financial processes and can guide you through the correct procedures.
