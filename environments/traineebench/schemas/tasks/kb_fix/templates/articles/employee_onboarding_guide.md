# Employee Onboarding Guide

Effective onboarding accelerates new hire productivity, builds confidence, and reduces attrition risk. This guide outlines the end-to-end workflow for managers, buddies, and HR partners.

## Principles

- Start before Day 1: clear expectations and access prepared.
- Prioritize context: mission, customers, product, and culture before tools.
- Teach by doing: pair practical tasks with learning modules.
- Close the loop: gather feedback at 2/6/12 weeks and iterate.

## Pre-boarding Checklist (Manager)

- Role definition: outcomes for 30/60/90 days, key projects, success signals.
- Access: email, calendar, chat, code repos, analytics, and shared drives.
- Equipment: laptop, accessories, security token, software licenses.
- Buddy assignment: peer in a related function with bandwidth and patience.
- Welcome note: team announcement with bio and initial responsibilities.

## Day 1 Agenda

1. Company orientation (mission, values, history)
2. HR paperwork (payroll, benefits, compliance acknowledgments)
3. IT & Security (password manager, MFA, endpoint policies)
4. Team intro (org map, stakeholders, rituals, communication norms)
5. Workspace tour (physical or virtual)

## Week 1 Learning Path

### Context Modules
- Customers & segments: who we serve and why they buy.
- Product overview: value prop, roadmap, quality gates.
- Go-to-market: channels, sales motion, messaging.

### Tools & Processes
- Project management and ticketing workflow.
- Code or content contribution guidelines.
- Decision logs and incident playbooks.

### Shadowing & Exercises
- Observe key meetings (standup, planning, review, retro).
- Complete a small scoped task end-to-end.
- Write a brief “what I learned” memo for feedback.

## 30/60/90 Plan Template

- 30 days: learn the domain, ship small contributions, establish relationships.
- 60 days: own a small project, propose improvements, document patterns.
- 90 days: lead a cross-functional deliverable, mentor newcomers, raise the bar.

## Manager’s Responsibilities

- Weekly 1:1s; unblock and coach.
- Curate relevant reading and observations.
- Provide timely feedback; celebrate small wins to build momentum.

## Buddy’s Responsibilities

- Offer practical tips (“how we do things here”).
- Offer safe space for questions; share mental models.
- Pair on one task per week for the first month.

## Feedback & Iteration

- Surveys at week 2, 6, and 12.
- Retro with manager: what to keep, start, stop.
- Share improvements back to HR to refine the playbook.

## Remote Onboarding Considerations

- Over-communicate availability and expectations.
- Use video for first conversations; document decisions in public channels.
- Async-friendly artifacts (design docs, demos, screencasts) reduce timezone friction.

## Conclusion

Onboarding is a team sport. A consistent, humane process compounds into higher performance and stronger culture.
