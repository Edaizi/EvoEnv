# Brand Campaign Postmortem

This document summarizes outcomes and learnings from the latest brand campaign. The goal is to convert observations into reusable playbooks and decision criteria for future initiatives.

## Objectives & Hypotheses

- Improve aided brand awareness by 8–12% in two priority regions.
- Increase high-intent website traffic by 20% with quality guardrails (bounce rate < 45%, time on site > 60s).
- Generate MQLs for next quarter while preserving unit economics.
- Hypothesis: creator partnerships + short-form video + localized landing pages will outperform traditional display.

## Strategy & Creative

- Messaging pillars: reliability, ease of adoption, measurable impact.
- Creative formats: short-form video, carousels, interactive stories, static banners for retargeting.
- Localization: country-specific CTAs, currency, and case-study mapping.

## Channel Mix

- Social (video-first): TikTok, Reels, YouTube Shorts
- Creator partnerships (tiered incentives)
- Search (brand + category)
- Display (retargeting only)
- Email (warm audiences, nurture sequences)

## What Worked

- Creative resonance: high completion rate on video units featuring product-in-context.
- Influencer partnerships: top decile creators drove 3× higher CTR and better downstream engagement.
- Localized proof: region-matched case studies improved demo requests by 18%.

## What Didn’t

- Over-segmentation: long-tail audiences under-delivered due to limited reach and learning.
- Display spend leakage: frequency caps misconfigured in first two weeks.
- Inefficient retargeting: creative fatigue increased cost-per-visit over time.

## Metrics Summary

- Aided awareness: +9.4% (target 8–12%)
- Site sessions: +23% QoQ; bounce rate 42%, avg time on site 74s
- MQL volume: +17% QoQ; SQL conversion flat
- CAC: +6% (mix shift toward creators; acceptable within range)

## Experiment Notes

- Variant A (creator-led) vs Variant B (brand-led): A won on CTR and time-on-site; B produced more consistent performance in smaller markets.
- Thumbnail testing: clear product visuals > abstract graphics.
- Copy: outcomes language (save time, reduce risk) outperformed feature lists.

## Risks & Mitigations

- Platform policy changes → diversify channels, maintain creative backlog.
- Creator dependency → build in-house content templates; expand mid-tier roster.
- Economic uncertainty → pre-define spend reduction ladders by performance thresholds.

## Playbook Updates

- Start with 60/30/10 split: creators / search / retargeting; rebalance weekly.
- Standardize localization checklist (legal, currency, examples, CTA).
- Introduce creative rotation every 10–14 days to avoid fatigue.

## Next Steps

- Deep-dive into SQL conversion bottlenecks; align with Sales on qualification criteria.
- Explore UGC pipelines and creator seeding kits.
- Build a cross-functional launch template for rapid replication in new regions.

## Conclusion

The campaign met awareness and traffic goals with healthy efficiency. By institutionalizing these learnings and tightening retargeting hygiene, we can compound the results in upcoming launches.
