- Success metrics defined (leading/lagging)
- Edge cases enumerated; non-goals clarified

## Engineering

- Feature flags and rollout plan (canary, cohort, geo)
- Observability: dashboards, alerts, logs, runbooks
- Security review complete; secrets handling audited

## Product & Design

- UX validated with target personas
- Content reviewed; localization ready if applicable
- Accessibility checks (contrast, keyboard nav, ARIA labels)

## Support & Operations

- Help center articles drafted; macros updated
- On-call playbook prepared; known issues documented
- Data migrations rehearsed and reversible

## Marketing & Sales

- Announcement plan: blog, email, social, in-app
- Sales enablement: one-pager, demo script, FAQ
- Launch tiers: soft launch vs. GA; feedback channel open

## Legal & Compliance

- Licensing and third-party attributions
- Data processing & privacy impact considered

## Conclusion

A reliable release is as much about coordination as it is about code. Use this checklist to shorten lead time and reduce risk.
