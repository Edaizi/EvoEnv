# Procurement and Vendor Management

Procurement ensures the company acquires goods and services at the right quality, cost, and risk profile. This guide outlines the operating model, controls, and collaboration patterns for vendor lifecycle management.

## Sourcing Strategy

- Clarify the requirement: outcomes, success metrics, and constraints.
- Market scan: shortlist vendors; document differentiators and references.
- RFP/RFI: structure questions to evaluate functionality, security, compliance, and support.

## Evaluation Criteria

- Total cost of ownership (TCO): license + implementation + training + switching.
- Security posture: certifications, penetration testing, incident response process.
- Data handling: retention, encryption, residency, sub-processors.
- Commercial terms: cancellation, price protections, renewal caps, usage tiers.

## Vendor Onboarding

- Due diligence: security and privacy questionnaires, financial stability review.
- Contracting: MSA + Order Form + DPAs; ensure alignment on SLAs.
- Implementation plan: owners, milestones, change management.

## Performance Management

- Quarterly Business Reviews: KPIs, roadmap alignment, incident review.
- SLA monitoring: uptime, response times, remedy credits.
- Cost control: check usage vs. entitlements; re-negotiate at renewal.

## Risk Management

- Concentration risk: backup vendors; export paths for data and configs.
- Compliance: maintain audits and evidence (SOC 2, ISO 27001, GDPR).
- Termination planning: offboarding steps, data deletion certificates.

## Collaboration Map

- Procurement: process and controls; negotiation playbooks.
- Security & Legal: risk and compliance checks; contracting policy.
- Finance: budget fit; invoice validation; accruals.
- Business Owners: requirements; adoption; value realization.

## Templates & Tools

- RFP template with scoring rubric
- Security questionnaire checklist
- Renewal calendar and pricing benchmarks

## Conclusion

Disciplined vendor management balances speed, quality, and risk. Treat vendors as partners, but manage with clear expectations and data.
