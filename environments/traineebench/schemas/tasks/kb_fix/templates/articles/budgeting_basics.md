# Budgeting Basics

Budgeting is the intentional process of planning how to allocate limited resources over a defined time horizon. A good budget converts strategy into numbers and creates guardrails that help teams prioritize, sequence, and execute.

Well-constructed budgets are living documents. They start with assumptions, but they must be reviewed and adjusted as reality unfolds. Leaders should tie budget checkpoints to the operating rhythm (monthly close, quarterly business reviews, annual planning, etc.).

## Core Concepts

### Income vs. Expenses
Income is the total inflow of funds from recurring and non-recurring sources (e.g., product revenue, services, grants). Expenses are outflows required to run the business: payroll, software, infrastructure, marketing, travel, and depreciation. The first principle is to maintain clarity on which levers influence each category and how quickly a change in decision manifests in the P&L.

### Fixed vs. Variable Costs
Fixed costs remain relatively stable across activity levels (e.g., rent or long-term software contracts), while variable costs scale with volume (e.g., shipping, payment processing fees). A common mistake is underestimating the slope of variable costs or ignoring semi-variable costs (e.g., support headcount that grows stepwise). Understanding cost behavior underpins scenario modeling.

### Operating, Investing, and Financing Activities
Cash flow statements separate activities into operating (day-to-day), investing (capital expenditures or acquisitions), and financing (debt/equity). Budgeting should align with cash timing, not just accrual accounting, especially for businesses with long receivable cycles or prepaid contracts.

## Planning Rhythm

### Annual Plan
The annual plan defines strategic bets, headcount envelopes, and capital allocation principles. It anchors company-wide goals (OKRs) and sets the tone for risk tolerance. Assumptions (pricing, win rates, churn, hiring ramps) must be documented and owned.

### Quarterly Forecast
Quarterly re-forecasts integrate real performance, pipeline quality, and macro signals. They are the moment to rebalance spend across functions, not merely roll forward variances. Mature teams run scenarios (base / upside / downside) with explicit triggers.

### Monthly Close & Variance Review
Each month, compare actuals against plan. Focus on *explainability*: what changed, why it changed, whether it is structural or temporary, and the actions required. Use variance thresholds to avoid noise and steer attention to material gaps.

## Building the Model

### Revenue Model
Break revenue down by segments (new vs. expansion, enterprise vs. SMB), attach rate drivers (pipeline coverage, conversion, sales capacity, ramp), and timing (deal cycle length, seasonality). Small shifts in assumptions compound; track cohort health and payback.

### Cost Model
Map cost centers to owners. For people costs, model hiring dates, ramp curves, and fully-loaded expenses (benefits, payroll taxes, equipment). For non-people costs, model unit economics (e.g., per-seat software), contract terms, and escalation clauses.

### Unit Economics
Compute contribution margin and LTV:CAC by segment. Tie them to the budget so growth decisions are constrained by efficiency targets, not just top-line goals. Unit economics turn the budget from an expense ledger into a strategic instrument.

## Controls and Governance

- Define ownership: every line has an accountable owner.
- Freeze windows: control changes near close; queue requests for the next cycle.
- Procurement hygiene: require quotes, evaluate total cost of ownership, and prefer cancellable terms for uncertain bets.
- Documentation: store assumptions and decisions with version history; make updates auditable.

## Communication

Budgets fail in silence. Communicate the *why* behind constraints and trade-offs. Publish an overview that links strategy to numbers, highlights risks, and spells out what happens if conditions worsen or improve.

## Quarterly Review Template

1. Executive summary (what changed and why)
2. Revenue performance (by segment and driver)
3. Cost review (people vs. non-people; variances and mitigations)
4. Cash runway and covenant checks
5. Scenario updates and triggers
6. Decisions required (reallocations, deferrals, new approvals)

## Common Pitfalls

- Sandbagging or wishful thinking—both erode trust.
- Ignoring cash timing in subscription businesses with annual prepay.
- Treating headcount as a number rather than a sequence of start dates and ramps.
- Overfitting to short-term noise; underreacting to persistent signals.

## Conclusion

A great budget is not a spreadsheet; it is a disciplined conversation that repeats rhythmically. When done well, it creates clarity, speed, and resilience.
