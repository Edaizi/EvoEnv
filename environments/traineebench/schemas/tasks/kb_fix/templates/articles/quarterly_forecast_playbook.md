# Quarterly Forecast Playbook

This playbook documents how to produce an accurate, explainable quarterly forecast that decision-makers trust. It aligns Finance, Sales, Marketing, Product, and Operations on one integrated narrative.

## Forecast Principles

- One source of truth: shared model, shared definitions, shared timelines.
- Explain before you project: root causes > curve fitting.
- Scenario-based thinking: base, upside, downside with explicit triggers.
- Short feedback loops: weekly forecast scrubs and assumption updates.

## Operating Cadence

### Week 1: Baseline & Data Hygiene
- Close prior month; reconcile pipeline states and attribution.
- Validate inputs: remove zombies, re-age deals, audit campaign tagging.
- Recompute conversion ladders and capacity ramps.

### Week 2: Driver Review
- Sales: coverage, stage-by-stage conversion, win rates, slips.
- Marketing: source mix, cost per qualified lead, lag effects.
- Product: launch schedule, pricing changes, new packaging.
- CS/RevOps: churn, expansion pipeline, discounts and term impacts.

### Week 3: Integrated Scenarios
- Base: most-likely path using validated drivers.
- Upside: quantified levers (e.g., +2 creator pods, +10% SDR capacity) and timing.
- Downside: macro or risk triggers; pre-drafted spend reductions.

### Week 4: Exec Review & Lock
- Publish executive summary and assumptions.
- Pre-commit to responses for each trigger (e.g., CAC > target, churn spike).
- Freeze for reporting; track deltas weekly.

## Model Architecture

- Revenue tower: new business vs. expansion, by segment and geo.
- Capacity: headcount by ramp stage; productivity curves.
- Marketing: channel stacks, elasticity, saturation limits.
- Pricing: ARPA, discount ladders, promotional windows.

## Common Failure Modes

- Hidden manual overrides; no audit trail.
- Ignoring seasonality or long sales cycles.
- Over-reliance on pipeline without cleaning or re-aging.

## Artifacts

- Forecast memo (assumptions, scenarios, risks, triggers)
- Driver deck (charts of conversion, capacity, and lag effects)
- Change log (what changed since last week and why)

## Conclusion

Good forecasts are conversations encoded in numbers. The goal is alignment, not perfection.
