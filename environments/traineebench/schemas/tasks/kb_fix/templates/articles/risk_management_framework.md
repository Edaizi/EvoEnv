# Risk Management Framework

This framework provides a common language and process for identifying, assessing, and treating risks across the organization.

## Taxonomy

- Strategic: market shifts, new entrants, disruptive tech
- Operational: process failures, outages, capacity constraints
- Financial: liquidity, credit, currency exposure
- Compliance: regulatory changes, audits, legal actions
- Security & Privacy: threats, vulnerabilities, incidents

## Process

1. Identify: capture risks in a shared register with owners
2. Assess: likelihood × impact, qualitative and quantitative
3. Treat: avoid, reduce, transfer, or accept with rationale
4. Monitor: triggers, thresholds, and KRIs (key risk indicators)
5. Report: dashboards to execs and board; decision logs

## Assessment Scales

- Likelihood: Rare / Unlikely / Possible / Likely / Almost Certain
- Impact: Insignificant / Minor / Moderate / Major / Critical
- Heatmaps: prioritize top-right and clusters of correlated risks

## Controls

- Preventive: access controls, code reviews, training
- Detective: monitoring, audits, anomaly detection
- Corrective: playbooks, backups, disaster recovery

## Business Continuity

- Impact analysis: recovery time objective (RTO), recovery point objective (RPO)
- Scenario testing: tabletop and live drills
- Supplier resilience: redundancy and exit plans

## Governance

- Ownership: each risk has an accountable executive
- Cadence: monthly ops review; quarterly deep dive; annual reset
- Documentation: versioned risk register; approved treatment plans

## Culture

- Psychological safety to report risks early
- Incentives aligned to risk-adjusted outcomes
- Celebrate near-misses and learning, not just avoidance

## Conclusion

A transparent and disciplined risk framework enables faster, safer bets. The goal is not zero risk, but risk well chosen.
