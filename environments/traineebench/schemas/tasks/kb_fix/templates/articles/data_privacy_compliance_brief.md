# Data Privacy and Compliance Brief

This brief outlines the principles, roles, and controls required to protect personal data and comply with global regulations.

## Principles

- Data minimization: collect only what is necessary.
- Purpose limitation: use data only for the stated purpose.
- Security by design: embed controls into systems and processes.
- Transparency: explain practices; honor subject rights.

## Regulatory Landscape

- GDPR (EU): lawful bases, DPO role, DPIAs, cross-border transfers
- CCPA/CPRA (California): opt-out, data selling/sharing definitions
- LGPD (Brazil), PIPEDA (Canada), PDPA (various APAC)

## Roles and Responsibilities

- Data Controller: determines purposes and means of processing
- Data Processor: processes data on behalf of Controller
- DPO: oversight, training, DPIAs, incident coordination
- Engineering & Product: privacy by design; data retention and deletion

## Controls Framework

- Access control: least privilege, RBAC, periodic reviews
- Encryption: at rest and in transit; key management policies
- Logging and monitoring: detect anomalous access and exfiltration
- Data lifecycle: classification, retention schedules, secure deletion

## Subject Rights

- Access: provide data copies within statutory timelines
- Rectification and erasure ("right to be forgotten")
- Portability in machine-readable formats
- Objection and restriction rights

## Vendor Risk Management

- DPAs with sub-processors; audit rights
- Data transfer mechanisms (SCCs); geographic restrictions
- Breach notification clauses and incident commitments

## Incident Response

- Detect, contain, eradicate, recover; document timelines
- Notify authorities and subjects when required
- Post-incident lessons and control improvements

## Training and Awareness

- Annual mandatory training for all employees
- Role-based deep dives for engineering, support, and marketing
- Phishing simulations and secure coding practices

## Conclusion

Privacy is a product feature and a trust moat. Compliance is the floor; ethical stewardship is the goal.
