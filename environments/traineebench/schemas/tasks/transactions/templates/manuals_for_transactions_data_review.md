Hello, at first, thank you for helping us with our data review task. Don't worry, here are some guidelines to help you understand how to do this.

First, unusual suppliers usually don't explicitly tell you they're unusual. We can only identify them by looking at patterns in their transaction data. Below are some patterns that appear in both normal and unusual data. Let's analyze the transaction data of each supplier one by one to uncover clues.

## Normal Data Patterns

- Stable Transactions: Suppliers with a supply history of more than one year and a clear rating. Transaction times are stable each month, and transaction amounts fluctuate within a certain range.

- Seasonal Transactions: Suppliers with a supply history of more than one year and a clear rating. Transaction times are stable each month, but transaction amounts fluctuate seasonally (companies always have off-seasons and peak seasons :D)

## Unusual Data Patterns

- Unexpectedly Appearing Suppliers: Suppliers with a supply history of about six months and frequent transactions. Suppliers **without** clear ratings, and transaction amounts are always within the approved authority (but very close to that authority).
